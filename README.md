ImgMatch
========

ImgMatch is a framework for image comparison and pattern recognition.

ImgMatch is free. It is licensed under LGPL.

It can be used to find similar images in a set or between two sets using
different, configurable algorithms.

Future plans include more matching algorithms implementation, OpenCV
integration, benchmarking, speed optimizations and more complex tasks
like recognizing/searching faces, shapes, fingerprints and text in images.

ImgMatch is written in C++, in an object-oriented and modular fashion.
It has a platform-independent GUI, which uses Qt framework.

To compile the source in Windows or Linux environments you need Qt SDK
(Qt-devel in Linux), g++ (MinGW in Windows) and bash (MSYS in Windows).
Then just run "make" in project's root directory. The executable file will
be in qtui/release directory.

A binary release for Windows, containing the executable and needed dll-s
is on the way.
