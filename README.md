ImgMatch
========

ImgMatch is a framework for image comparison and pattern recognition.

ImgMatch is free. It is licensed under LGPL.

It can be used to find similar images in a set or between two sets, using
different, configurable algorithms.

Currently only one algorithm is implemented. Future plans include more
matching algorithms implementation, OpenCV integration, benchmarking, speed
optimizations and more complex tasks like recognizing/searching faces, shapes,
fingerprints and text in images.

ImgMatch is written in C++, in an object-oriented and modular fashion.
ImgMatch has a platform-independent GUI, which uses Qt4 framework.

To compile the source in Windows or Linux environments you need Qt4 and g++.
Then just type "make" in the project root directory. The executable file will
be in the qtui/release directory.

I plan to make a self-sufficient binary distribution for Windows, containing
the executable and needed dll-s.
